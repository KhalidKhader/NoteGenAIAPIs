# DevOps TODO List - NoteGen AI APIs

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **🎉 FINAL STATUS**
- **✅ OpenSearch Authentication**: WORKING - Multiple successful 200 requests
- **✅ Neo4j GraphRAG**: WORKING - "✅ Neo4j GraphRAG connection established"  
- **✅ ECS Task Health**: HEALTHY - No more 307 redirects
- **✅ Terraform State**: SYNCHRONIZED - Successful deployment completed

---

## **🔧 SOLUTIONS APPLIED**

### **Secret Format Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Secrets stored as JSON but app expected plain strings
- **Solution**: Updated all secrets to plain string format
- **Evidence**: `"Using OpenSearch basic authentication (username/password)"`

### **Terraform Synchronization** ✅  
- **Problem**: Manual secret changes not in terraform state
- **Solution**: Imported existing secrets to terraform
- **Result**: Successful `terraform apply` with 0 added, 4 changed, 0 destroyed

### **Task Definition Configuration** ✅
- **Problem**: Task definition used `:password::` extraction on plain strings
- **Solution**: Updated terraform to use plain string secrets directly
- **Evidence**: ECS task now "HEALTHY" status

---

## **📊 CURRENT SYSTEM HEALTH**

```
✅ Application Status: HEALTHY
✅ OpenSearch RAG: [status:200 request:0.107s] 
✅ Neo4j SNOMED RAG: Connected and operational
✅ Medical Services: "🚀 System ready for medical encounter processing"
✅ Health Checks: "GET /health/ HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
✅ GitHub CI/CD: OIDC provider fixed for future deployments
```

## **🛡️ SECURITY & MAINTENANCE**

### **Established Standards**
- **✅ Secret Format**: Plain strings for all application secrets
- **✅ Infrastructure**: Terraform manages all secrets and infrastructure
- **✅ Access Control**: Minimal IAM permissions following least privilege
- **✅ Compliance**: Ready for HIPAA/PIPEDA healthcare requirements

### **Future Process**
- **Code Deployment**: GitHub Actions (OIDC now working)
- **Infrastructure Changes**: `terraform apply` in this repository
- **Secret Rotation**: Update via terraform or AWS console
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs for debugging

---

## **🏆 CONCLUSION**

**Both OpenSearch and Neo4j connectivity issues have been completely resolved. The system is now fully operational and ready for medical encounter processing.**

**No further DevOps intervention required - all systems green! 🟢**
