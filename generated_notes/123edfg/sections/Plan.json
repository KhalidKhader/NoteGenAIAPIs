Each statement in the 'Plan' section is directly supported by the conversation between the doctor and the patient. The recommendations for rest, hydration, over-the-counter pain relievers, and the follow-up advice for a strep test if symptoms worsen are all explicitly mentioned in the transcript. The line references, although not directly verifiable due to the format of the transcript, do not affect the factual accuracy of the content. Therefore, there are no issues found, and the hallucination risk is low."
