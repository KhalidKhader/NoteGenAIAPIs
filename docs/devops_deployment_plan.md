# NoteGen AI APIs â€“ Production DevOps & Deployment Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the production DevOps and deployment strategy for the NoteGen AI APIs microservice. It covers infrastructure provisioning (Terraform), secret/configuration management, CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions), ECS deployment, and healthcare compliance requirements. The plan is designed for multiple environments (staging/prod), with the environment name passed as a variable to Terraform.

**Repository Structure Decision:**
- **Terraform code is kept in the same repository as the application codebase.** This enables atomic changes, easier code review, and simpler management for tightly coupled infrastructure and application updates.

**Key Implementation Status:**
- âœ… Neo4j is provisioned and managed directly by Terraform as an ECS service with EFS persistent storage
- âœ… Neo4j container uses AWS ECR Public Gallery images to avoid Docker Hub rate limits
- âœ… Backup restoration is handled by Terraform using null_resource with one-time ECS tasks
- âœ… All modules implemented: VPC, ECR, OpenSearch, ECS Service, Neo4j
- âœ… Multi-environment support (staging/prod) with proper state isolation

---

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) - âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### 2.1. AWS Resources Provisioned

#### âœ… **VPC & Networking**
- Custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- Security groups for ECS services, Neo4j, and EFS
- Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity

#### âœ… **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**
- Private ECR repository for FastAPI application images
- Lifecycle policies for image cleanup
- Cross-account access policies for CI/CD

#### âœ… **OpenSearch Service (Vector Search)**
- Managed OpenSearch cluster for vector search and transcript storage
- VPC-based deployment in private subnets
- Access policies for ECS tasks
- Encrypted at rest and in transit

#### âœ… **AWS Secrets Manager**
